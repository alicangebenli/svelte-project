### Project
```shell
docker build -t app .
docker run -dp 3000:3000 app
```
To run the project in a development environment, run the following commands:
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Additionally, I did not develop component tests for the project. Due to the workload on my plate this week, I wanted to make sure it wasn't delayed at the company.
